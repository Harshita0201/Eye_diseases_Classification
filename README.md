# Eye_Diseases_Classification
A deep learning based CNN model, for classifying 4 different classes of eye diseases.
The classes of retinal eye images used are - "Normal", "Cataract", "Glaucoma" and "Diabetic Retinopathy". 
The dataset was picked from kaggle which consists of over 4200 retinal eye images of different classes.
Pandas, Numpy, keras, tensorflow, sklearn, etc are some of the libraries used to build the model. 
The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% test sets. 
The model is trained on training set, over 4 convolutional layers and 1 fully connected layer, for 150 epochs.
For the purpose of evaluation - classfication report and a confusion matrix was plot.
